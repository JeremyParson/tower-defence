# NJIT-SD-03 Milestone Project: Planning

--------

## Project Description

My project is tower defence.

## Game Logic
```
Enemies will spawn and move towards your base on a path
Player builds towers alongside path.
Killing enemies grants points
    Points are used to upgrade and build towers
You lose when the enemy destroys your base
```

## Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- Player will be able to build towers
- Enemies will spawn on a path
- Player loses when base is destroyed

### Post-MVP Plans

- Impliment a system that gives certain towers "active abilities".
- Create a rudimentry map editor
- Create an online multiplayer VS mode utilizing node js and websockets
